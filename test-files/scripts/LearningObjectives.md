# Stage - Storing Data Sequentially

## Video - Lists of Data

1. Recall that a collection is a structure that contains multiple values (1)
2. Recall that in Swift there are three basic collection types - Array, Dictionary and Set (1)
3. Recall that data in an array is stored in an ordered sequence (1)
4. Recall that an array can be thought of as a ordered series of constants where instead of a name each constant is assigned a number and the entire array is given a name (1)
5. Recall that the number used to refer to containers in an array is known as an index (1)
6. Recall that array indexes in Swift start at 0 not 1 (1)
7. Recall that when an array is assigned to a constant, the name of the constant refers to the entire array (1)
8. Recall that a data structure is a way of storing data along with defined ways of operating on the data (1)
9. Recall that to create an array literal the first step is to write out a set of square brackets (1)
10. Recall that to create an array literal the second step is to list out the values inside the square brackets separated by commas (1)
11. Recall that to work with an array literal previously declared it needs to be assigned to a variable or constant (1)
12. Differentiate between declaring an array literal and assigning it to a constant (2)
