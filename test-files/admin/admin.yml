  title: Swift Arrays
  topic: Swift
  description: In the past we've only worked with a single item of data in a constant
    or a variable. There's much more to this of course, and working with groups or
    collections of data is an important part of programming. In this course we'll
    look at the the first fundamental type that we use in Swift to represent these
    collections - Arrays

      create them

      - title: Recall that a collection is a structure that contains multiple values
        cognitive_level: recall
        topic: Swift
      - title: Recall that in Swift there are three basic collection types - Array,
          Dictionary and Set
        cognitive_level: recall
        topic: Swift
      - title: Recall that data in an array is stored in an ordered sequence
        cognitive_level: recall
        topic: Swift
      - title: Recall that an array can be thought of as a ordered series of constants
          where instead of a name each constant is assigned a number and the entire
          array is given a name
        cognitive_level: recall
        topic: Swift
      - title: Recall that the number used to refer to containers in an array is known
          as an index
        cognitive_level: recall
        topic: Swift
      - title: Recall that array indexes in Swift start at 0 not 1
        cognitive_level: recall
        topic: Swift
      - title: Recall that when an array is assigned to a constant, the name of the
          constant refers to the entire array
        cognitive_level: recall
        topic: Swift
      - title: Recall that a data structure is a way of storing data along with defined
          ways of operating on the data
        cognitive_level: recall
        topic: Swift
      - title: Recall that to create an array literal the first step is to write out
          a set of square brackets
        cognitive_level: recall
        topic: Swift
      - title: Recall that to create an array literal the second step is to list out
          the values inside the square brackets separated by commas
        cognitive_level: recall
        topic: Swift
      - title: Recall that to work with an array literal previously declared it needs
          to be assigned to a variable or constant
        cognitive_level: recall
        topic: Swift
      - title: Differentiate between declaring an array literal and assigning it to
          a constant
